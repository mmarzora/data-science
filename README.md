# My Projects
## World: World Economic Freedom & Happiness Report
In this project I'll be analyzing the Economic Freedom Index and the World Happiness Report to try to understand if the Life Evaluation score could be explained by the metrics in these reports. 
Some questions I will ask are: 
- What are the characteristics of each region of the world? 
- Which countries have similar behaviors? 
- Which metrics tend to be more correlated between countries? 
- Can the Life Evaluation score be explained with a linear model that uses Economic Freedom Index variables? 
- Which countries have a larger deviation from the explanation given by the economic linear model? 

Capabilities: analysis, research, data visualization, manipulating and joining multiple datasets, cluster analysis, linear regression, conclusions and insights

## Churn prediction (Predicción de bajas en una compañía de seguros)
Predicting churn for an insurance company. Starting with exploratory data analysis before training several models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression; tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best model. This project includes pipelines for pre-processing data and training the machine learning models, and performance comparison with different sets of hyperparameters.

Capabilities: machine learning, decision tree, random forest, xgboost, hyperparameter selection, pipelines, gridsearch, selecting the most useful model
