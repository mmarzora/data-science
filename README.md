## World: Economic Freedom Index & Happiness Report
This project explores how economic and government indices can explain the wellbeing of a population. An extensive analysis of these factors was conducted to better understand their connection and gain insights into what contributes to societal well-being. The results shed light on various aspects, including:
- The general behavior of each region of the world, and similarities across countries
- Relationships between different metrics like GDP growth, Fiscal Health, Government Spending, etc
- What do the best performing countries have in common
- Explainability of the "Life Evaluation Score" by economic and government metrics
- Which countries can be explained, and which have more deviations

The following statistical and machine learning methods were used:
- Clustering
- Correlations
- Linear regression

All of the data was obtained from the Economic Freedom Index and the World Happiness Report.

Capabilities: analysis, research, data visualization, manipulating and joining multiple datasets, cluster analysis, linear regression, conclusions and insights


## Churn prediction (Predicción de bajas en una compañía de seguros)
Predicting churn for an insurance company. Starting with exploratory data analysis before training several models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression; tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best model. This project includes pipelines for pre-processing data and training the machine learning models, and performance comparison with different sets of hyperparameters.

Capabilities: machine learning, decision tree, random forest, xgboost, hyperparameter selection, pipelines, gridsearch, selecting the most useful model
