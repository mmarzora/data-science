# MovieAnalyzer Dash App

This is a Dash-based interactive dashboard for analyzing movies using PCA quadrants, genre filtering, and text-based similarity search.

## Features
- Interactive scatter plot of movies by PCA quadrants
- Genre filtering
- Movie search and highlight
- Text input for finding most similar movies (using embeddings)
- Genre composition bar chart

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Make sure `quadrant_data.json` (generated by your data export script) is available in the `../analysis/` directory relative to this app.

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8050` to view the dashboard.

## Notes
- The text similarity search currently uses a dummy embedding function. Replace `embed_text` in `app.py` with your real embedding model for best results.
- All logic is in Python; no JavaScript required.
